Welcome to the virutal pet simulator.

This project will involve a virtual dog, who you can adopt from a range of breeds which will each have independent characteristics. The dog will have its needs decay, and the user can take care of the dog's various needs as well as teach the dog tricks and interact with the dog in other ways. Each breed will have different characteristics such as learning at different rates and having needs decay at different rates.
